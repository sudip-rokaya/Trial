"""Example RL fine-tuning setup for a love letter generator.

This script demonstrates the basic structure for reinforcement fine-tuning
using the OpenAI API. The idea is to collect user-provided love letters and
public domain romantic text as your training data. You then define a reward
function that scores generated letters based on desired characteristics (e.g.,
romantic tone, adherence to user style).

Actual RL training with the OpenAI API requires calling OpenAI endpoints for
completion generation and logging rewards. Here we show the expected flow with
placeholder functions. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` and dataset paths with real data.
