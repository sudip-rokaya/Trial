# Trial

This repository demonstrates a small prototype for a personalized love-letter generator using OpenAI reinforcement fine-tuning. The system **does not** include a screenshot feature and **does not** scrape Pinterest.

## Components

- `fine_tune_openai.py`: Example script showing how to setup reinforcement fine-tuning with OpenAI API.
- `data/`: Placeholder directory for user-provided love letters and open-license romantic text.

The approach focuses on training with user permission and publicly available datasets.
